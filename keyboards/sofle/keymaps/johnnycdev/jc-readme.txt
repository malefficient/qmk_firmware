Figure out the Mac/Win/Lin mode switching support in default keymap (note the modifier status)

Figure out the 'master' left v right thing. Also, check about transmitting the modifier split status for OLED display (relevant sine asymettric)
#define SPLIT_MODS_ENABLE

checkout #define SPLIT_USB_DETECT

Is there a downside to using this? Seems like a sane default

does the mapping between 'master'/'slave' imply 'left' vs 'right' ?
Checkout the CONSOLE_ENABLED //CONSOLE_ENABLED=yes

Future work:
